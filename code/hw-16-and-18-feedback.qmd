## HW 16 and 18 feedback

## Homework 16

Think about how you separate your code comments (inside of a code chunk) from your scientific thinking comments (outside of a code chunk). For example, on line 29, you have:

```{r}
levels(cover$Site) #levels are inconsistent and must be fixed
```

The comment is not really about how you wrote the code, but about the problem in the data that needs to be fixed, so that comment should go outside of a code chunk. The result is that you will have more, smaller code chunks rather than a few larger code chunks. Work on this.

Your group_by and summarise sections look good.

## Homework 18 - plotting

You did a better job of separating scientific comments from code comments in this one. Keep it up!
