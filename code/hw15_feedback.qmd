## Homework 15 feedback

You can skip line 12 because dplyr is loaded when you call `library(tidyverse)` on line 10.

Try looking at the visual version of your .qmd file. You are using headings, rather than  just more narrative text, to describe what you are doing. For example at line 7 you have ##Set Up

Also, if you don't leave a space between # and the heading text, it will not render as a heading.

I tweaked this on lines 15 and 23 so you could see the difference (assuming  you use the visual view).

Also, I think it would benefit you to think a bit more about what kinds of comments to put inside of code chunks, e.g. 

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) #clear R's brain
```

vs the kind of narration you provide outside of code chunks to represent your thinking/what you are trying to achieve with your code, etc.
