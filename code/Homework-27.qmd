Read through the code in this assignment. You will begin contributing to the code on line 36. Your tasks will be to:

-   Create a dataframe with just the complete cases

-   Review the 1-way ANOVA we ran during class with the full data set

-   Conduct a 2nd 1-way ANOVA using just the data set with complete cases and compare the results to the first analysis.

-   Conduct a linear regression to assess the relationship b/w Growth_rate_mm and Dried_mass_g, first with the complete data set and second with the complete cases data set and compare the results of the 2 analyses.

## Set up our workspace and read in the data

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(ggfortify)
library(here)
```

Read in the data.

```{r}
df <- read.csv(here("Data/learn-about-NA.csv"))
str(df)
```

## Dealing with NAs in data analysis

Deciding how to treat NA values in your data can have critical impacts on your data analysis.

Let's look at an example.

Start by creating a data frame from df called df_All_NA, which includes the entire dataset including all NA values.

```{r}
df_All_NA <- df
```

Now use one of the methods we discussed in class on 13 November to create a second dataframe called `df_No_NA` that is just the complete cases of df.

```{r}
df_No_NA <- na.omit(df)
```

What if we wanted to test the hypothesis that there is no effect of fertilizer treatment on plant growth rate?

In class on Wednesday 13 November we ran a 1-way ANOVA on the complete data set. Let's review it here:

### First ANOVA using all the data

#### Plot and Guess

```{r}
ggplot(df_All_NA, aes(Treatment, Growth_rate_mm))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

We decided that there was likely an effect of treatment on growth rate, but we weren't sure if both levels of the fertilizer treatment would differ from the control.

#### Create a model:

```{r}
grow.mod<-lm(Growth_rate_mm ~ Treatment, data = df_All_NA)
```

#### Check our assumptions:

```{r}
autoplot(grow.mod)
```

Looks pretty good.

#### Interpret results:

```{r}
anova(grow.mod)
```

Practice your interpretation.

There is a weak association between fertilizer treatment and plant growth rate (F=3.6937, DF=2, p=0.02353).

Why are there 2 DF for the Treatment effect?

Answer: Because there are 3 levels of our Treatment variable: Control, Level 1, and Level 2. Number of groups - 1 = degrees of freedom therefore 3 - 1 = 2.

Why are there 46 DF for the Residuals? Remember that we determined that there were 49 values in the `Growth_rate_mm` variable using `sum(!is.na(variable))` like this:

```{r}
sum(!is.na(df$Growth_rate_mm))
```

So **there are only 49 data points used in the analysis**, even though the dataframe is 60 rows long!!!

49 - 3 = 46 = degrees of freedom for the residuals.

```{r}
summary(grow.mod)
```

Practice your interpretation:

Does adding 1 dose of fertilizer change the growth rate significantly from the Control?

Adding one dose of fertilizer does not significantly change the growth rate of these plants (t = 1.783, p=0.0812).

Does adding 2 doses of fertilizer change the growth rate significantly from the Control?

Adding two doses of fertilizer significantly increases the growth rate of these plants (t = 2.659, p = 0.0108).

We won't worry about re-plotting our data right now.

### Second Attempt: Complete Cases

Your turn. Run the 1-way ANOVA again, this time with only the dataset that has complete cases and that we called `df_No_NA`

#### Plot and Guess

```{r}
ggplot(df_No_NA, aes(Treatment, Growth_rate_mm))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

What do you think?

There seems to be a difference in growth rates between the fertilizer treatments and the control treatment. There doesn't seem to be too much of a difference between the two fertilzer treatments.

#### Create a model:

```{r}
grow.mod.no.NA <- lm(Growth_rate_mm ~ Treatment, data = df_No_NA)
```

#### Check our assumptions:

```{r}
autoplot(grow.mod.no.NA)
```

What do you think? Same or different from our first 1-way ANOVA?

Mostly okay. Q-Q plot is a little iffy but not too bad.

#### Interpret results:

```{r}
anova(grow.mod.no.NA)
```

Practice your interpretation.

Why are there 2 DF for the Treatment effect?

3 groups minus 1

Why are there 33 DF for the Residuals?

36 observations minus 3 groups is 33.

How would you write a results statement?

There is no association between plant growth rate and fertilizer treatment (F=2.7906, df=2, p=0.759). (ENDS ANALYSIS, FAIL TO REJECT NULL HYPOTHESIS)

```{r}
summary(grow.mod.no.NA)
```

Practice your interpretation:

Does adding 1 dose of fertilizer change the growth rate significantly from the Control?

Adding one dose of fertilizer treatment did not significantly change the plant growth rate (t = 1.624, p = 0.1139).

Does adding 2 doses of fertilizer change the growth rate significantly from the Control?

Adding 2 doses of fertilizer does significantly change the growth rate of these plants (t = 2.232, p = 0.0325).

We won't worry about re-plotting our data right now.

## Linear Regression

Now conduct a linear regression to examine the relationship between `Growth_rate_mm` and `Dried_mass_g`, first with the complete data set and second with the complete cases data set and compare the results of the 2 analyses.

### First attempt: Full data set including NAs (use `df_All_NA`)

You know what to do here. Go for it.

#### Plot and guess

```{r}
ggplot(df_All_NA, aes(x = Growth_rate_mm, y = Dried_mass_g))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

There doesn't seem to be a strong association between growth rate and dried mass. There may be a very weak positive relationship between the two variables.

#### Create model

```{r}
mass.mod <- lm(Dried_mass_g ~ Growth_rate_mm, data = df_All_NA)
```

#### Check assumptions

```{r}
autoplot(mass.mod)
```

Don't worry if assumptions don't look perfect - focus on normality of the data.

Normality is okay then.

#### Interpret model

Use `anova()` first before using `summary()`

```{r}
anova(mass.mod)
```

Why is there 1 degree of freedom for Growth_rate_mm and why are there 34 degrees of freedom for the Residuals?

1 degree of freedom for 1 predictor variable

34 degrees of freedom for number of used observations - 2.

There is a moderate association between dry mass and growth rate (F = 10.805, df = 1, p = 0.002356).

```{r}
summary(mass.mod)
```

There is a week positve association between dry mass and growth rate (r\^2 = 0.2188).

r-squared - percent of variability in x variable that can be explained by y variable

### Second attempt: Limited data set with only complete cases (use `df_No_NA`)

#### Plot and guess

```{r}
ggplot(df_No_NA, aes(x = Growth_rate_mm, y = Dried_mass_g))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

There appears to be a week positive association between growth rate and dry mass. The relationship may not be linear.

#### Create model

```{r}
mass.mod.no.NA <- lm(Dried_mass_g ~ Growth_rate_mm, data = df_No_NA)
```

#### Check assumptions

```{r}
autoplot(mass.mod.no.NA)
```

Again, don't worry if the assumptions aren't perfect. How do they compare to the first analysis?

They look the same.

#### Interpret model

Use `anova()` first then `summary()`.

```{r}
anova(mass.mod.no.NA)
summary(mass.mod.no.NA)
```

Answer the following questions:

1.  How many degrees of freedom are there for Growth_rate_mm? Why?

    Growth_rate_mm has 1 degree of freedom for two variables minus one.

2.  How many degrees of freedom are there for Residuals? Why?

    There are 34 residuals for number of observations minus 2 predictors.

3.  How are the degrees of freedom in this second model different than the first? What does the answer tell you about the role of NA values in the regression analysis?

There are the same number of residuals for both models. I think R omitted the NA variables in the construction of the linear model. I get a popup in the console window that says "Warning message: Removed 24 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`)."
